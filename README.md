## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you have the project files.**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/cv-builder-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you should see output in your terminal indicating the local address where the application is running (usually `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.
